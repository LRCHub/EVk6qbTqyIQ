This silence
This silence over your shoulder
Will haunt you
Will haunt you till you get older

Then that silence
Will turn to noise
That silence
Like a looming voice will call to you

I feel the texture that covers the damp walls
I spent forever just yelling through dark halls
I have to feel for the signals coming through
A stark vibration; I know it must be you

I feel the texture that covers the damp walls
I spent forever just yelling through dark halls
I have to feel for the signals coming through
A stark vibration, I know it's you

Devoid of sound
Devoid of sound
No siren call sung
No siren call sung

Devoid of sound
Devoid of sound
These echoes have run
Their course from now on

No voice remains

Did you ever feel a heart (heart, heart...)
Heart without a beat
