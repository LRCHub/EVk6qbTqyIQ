Cooling me so bright, the light is stunning over the motions again
Threw away delight in spite of nothing over we're older again
She digs her heals over there
Fool's serene survive soon she'll rationalize
Fooling me so slight, his smiles cunning over-emotion again
Newer ways and insights in light of nothing, over they're older again
He leaves my needs over there
Gleaming seas arise, soon she'll rationalize
Over and over, the show flies discover! through warm fields
Over and over the snow lies uncovered through the storm fields
Please lead us through the remains
Moving me so bright, his smiles stunning, over the notions again
Fewer days in fright the ladies gunning, overline goshen remains
He preaches fear over there
Gleaming seas arise, soon she'll rationalize
Over and over, the show flies discover! wander through the warm fields
Over and over the snow lies uncovered throughout the storm fields
They laze in dawn-light fire,
The morning dew rolls over the planet,
Clear words child! far away plans
The skies sublime lunation towards the setting sun,
With eyes of painted dilation towards the fragile sun,
Their sight in firm fixation towards the setting sun,
We've seen the ruined foundations towards he fragile sun
Gleaming seas, horizons weaving
Gleaming seas, horizons weave through time
