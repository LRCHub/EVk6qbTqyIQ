It all remains on me
At night can't sleep
It all remains such a mystery
Can't wake up to this break down, can't fake it 'cause it's real

This time you'll see
The bruising will not leave
At night can't sleep
It all remains such a mystery

Things happen this way
Don't let it stay

This time you'll see
It all remains on me
At night can't sleep
It all remains such a mystery
She'll sleep through this complete ruin, with eyes closing we ride on

Things happen this way
Don't let it stay
Deep down inside
You know you tried

This time you'll see, it all remains on me
